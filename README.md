### Filter by center name:
![centerName](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b09ad343-84eb-4105-b209-f1fb0ef655ec)
### Filter by course offered:
![course](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70c37e0e-c0a3-4986-9104-2364672b10f4)
### Get all centers:
![all](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46e33261-b6d6-41a3-8a74-a5250b8839fc)

## Validation
- Mandatory fields are validated using annotations such as @NotBlank, @Size, @Email, and @Pattern..
- The application uses Spring's @ExceptionHandler to handle validation errors gracefully.

### Example:
![validation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17231207-869c-4c20-a329-51a8b1251cfc)


## Database Configuration
- The application connects to a MySQL database. Configure the database properties in application.properties:

**Look like:**
```

spring.application.name=Liv2train_registry
#changing the server port
server.port=8080
#db specific properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/TrainingCenters
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root

#ORM s/w specific properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy = ANT_PATH_MATCHER


```
### In DataBase data look like:
