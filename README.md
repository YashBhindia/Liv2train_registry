- Retrieve a list of all training centers, with optional filtering.
### Query Parameters:

  - centerName (optional): Filter by center name.
  - course (optional): Filter by course offered.

### Filter by center name:
![centername1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26293837-6e71-4a7e-9976-f704e0484cbb)
### Filter by course offered:
![course1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94128f60-1fd0-4fbb-80ad-dedabd367ba6)

![all1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/813355e2-142f-4499-aa8b-5a4e4bfbfb77)

## Validation
- Mandatory fields are validated using annotations such as @NotBlank, @Size, @Email, and @Pattern..
- The application uses Spring's @ExceptionHandler to handle validation errors gracefully.

### Example:
![validation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17231207-869c-4c20-a329-51a8b1251cfc)


## Database Configuration
- The application connects to a MySQL database. Configure the database properties in application.properties:

**Look like:**
```

spring.application.name=Liv2train_registry
#changing the server port
server.port=8080
#db specific properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/TrainingCenters
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root

#ORM s/w specific properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy = ANT_PATH_MATCHER


```
### In DataBase data look like:
